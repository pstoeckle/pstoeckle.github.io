- skill: IT  Security and Security Configuration
  description: >
    During my studies, I learned a lot about the theoretical concepts of IT security.
    Later, in my Ph.D., I was working on a cooperation project between the 
    Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the <a href="https://www.siemens.com/">Siemens AG</a> on the topic
    of security configuration.
    Security misconfigurations enable many cyberattacks and make most of them easier than necessary.
    In this project, I learned a lot about practical IT security and developed tools to help administrators to
    harden their systems.
    If organizations hardened their infrastructure now, they would prevent data breaches and ransomware attacks in the future.
- skill: Teaching and Supervision
  description: >
    I like to teach others and motivate them to learn new things.
    I was the leading teaching assistant for the course
    <a href='https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=460596'>Security Engineering</a>
    at the TUM from 2019 until 2022, with ca. 300 enlisted students every year.
    During this time, I replaced much of the existing but outdated course material with more recent and relevant content.
    Furthermore, I introduced hands-on programming exercises;
    I provided the exercises to the students via the <a href="https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis">Artemis Learning Platform</a>.
    Before introducing these programming exercises, there were only a couple of student submissions every week.
    Afterward, over 80 students submitted, on average, a working solution per week.
    It still makes me happy that I motivated these students to not only study the theory for the exam but also make
    their hands dirty and implement the stuff and, thus, learn even more. <br>
    During my time at the TUM, I supervised 13 bachelor's/master's theses .
    Although I supervised them, I learned a lot from my students.
    Supporting others with advice and guidance and seeing how they
    solved some problems I struggled with or came up with ideas I had never thought about was an incredible experience.
- skill: Programming and Software Engineering
  description: >
    I am an experienced programmer with a lot of experience in different languages.
    Currently, the language I use the most is Python üêç, but I learned to program with Java. ‚òïÔ∏è
    During my studies, I also programmed in C, Haskell, TypeScript, C++, Xtend, and Kotlin.
    Furthermore, I am very passionate about everything around writing the actual software. <br>
    Version control with git is, for me, a pivotal part of handling any software project, and
    I worked a lot with continuous integration tools such <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">GitLab CI/CD</a>.
    Thanks to an excellent course at the TUM, I also learned a lot about REST, Microservices, Docker, Protobuff, and Spring.
    All these concepts, frameworks, and tools can help us as programmers enormously when writing, deploying and maintaining software.
