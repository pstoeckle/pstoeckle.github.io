- skill: IT  Security and Security Configuration
  description: >
    Since the IT security focus in my master's degree, I have been heavily involved with this.
    Later, in my Ph.D., I worked on a cooperation project between the 
    Technical University of Munich (TUM) and <a href="https://www.siemens.com/">Siemens</a> on security configuration.
    Security misconfigurations enable many cyberattacks and make most of them easier than necessary.
    Through the experience of that project, I know very well about practical IT security problems and how to fix them.
    In the industry project, I developed tools to help administrators to harden their systems.
    If organizations hardened their infrastructure using these tools now, they would prevent data breaches and ransomware attacks in the future.
- skill: Teaching and Supervision
  description: >
    I am a good teacher who can help people better understand complex matters.
    From 2019 until 2022, I was the leading teaching assistant for the course
    <a href='https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=460596'>Security Engineering</a>
    at the TUM, with ca. 300 enlisted students every year.
    I renovated much of the existing but outdated course material during this time and added more recent and relevant content.
    Furthermore, I introduced hands-on programming exercises;
    I provided the exercises to the students via the <a href="https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis">Artemis Learning Platform</a>.
    Before introducing these programming exercises, there were only a couple of student submissions every week.
    Afterward, over 80 students submitted, on average, a working solution per week.
    Motivating these students to not only study the theory for the exam but also make
    their hands dirty and implement the stuff made them learn even more. <br>
    During my time at the TUM, I supervised 13 bachelor's/master's theses.
    Although I supervised them, I learned a lot from my students.
    Supporting others with advice and guidance and seeing how they
    solved some problems I struggled with or came up with ideas I had never thought about was an incredible experience.
- skill: Programming and Software Engineering
  description: >
    I am an experienced programmer with a lot of experience in different languages.
    Currently, the language I use the most is Python üêç, but I learned to program with Java ‚òïÔ∏è.
    During my studies, I also programmed in C, C++, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>,
    <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/">Xtend</a>, and <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>.
    Currently, I'm working a lot with <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/">Rego</a> which is inspired by Datalog/Prolog.
    Furthermore, I am very passionate about everything around writing the actual software. <br>
    For me, version control with git is a pivotal part of handling any software project, and
    I worked a lot with continuous integration tools such <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">GitLab CI/CD</a>.
    Thanks to an excellent course at the TUM, I know a lot about REST, Microservices, Docker, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Protocol Buffers</a>, and <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a>.
    All these concepts, frameworks, and tools can help us as programmers enormously when writing, deploying and maintaining software.
