    I'm a dog owner since 2021. I love to spend time outside with my wife and our dog on walks within the city of
    Munich and hikes outside the city, for example, in the Alps. 🐕🥾⛰

    I love to go to museums and visit exhibitions. 🖼
    My favorite permanent exhibition in the city of Munich is the <a href="https://www.lenbachhaus.de/">Lenbachhaus</a>,
    but I really like the temporary exhibitions of the <a href="https://www.kunsthalle-muc.de/">Kunsthalle</a>

    <a href="https://www.gaertnerplatztheater.de/de/start/index.html">Gärtnerplatztheater</a> for operas and the
    <a href="https://www.muenchner-volkstheater.de/">Volkstheater</a> for plays.
